You give Ned a good-bye pat, then you and Waldo carry your bags to the waiting cab. One look at the cloudless January sky and you're glad you decided to fly.
"Anyway," you say to Waldo, "The sooner I'm in Alice, the better."
"Be careful," Waldo tells you for the tenth time.
"I will," you promice. "I really appreciate your help, Waldo! I couldn't do this without you."
